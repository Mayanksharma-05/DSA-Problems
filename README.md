ðŸ“Œ DSA Problems Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, primarily solved on LeetCode. All solutions are implemented in Java and cover a wide range of topics, from basic concepts to advanced algorithms.

The main purpose of this repository is to:

ðŸ“š Strengthen my problem-solving and analytical skills

ðŸ§  Build a strong foundation in DSA concepts for technical interviews and competitive programming

ðŸ’¾ Keep a structured record of my coding practice for future reference

ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered

Arrays & Strings

Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

Stacks & Queues

Hashing & HashMaps

Recursion & Backtracking

Trees & Binary Search Trees

Graphs (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path)

Heaps & Priority Queues

Sorting & Searching Algorithms

Dynamic Programming & Greedy Algorithms

ðŸ”¹ Features

Well-structured Java solutions with clear code formatting

Includes problem statements (where allowed) or links to LeetCode

Optimized solutions with explanations and comments for better understanding

Gradual addition of new problems as I continue solving

ðŸ“Œ Usage

You can browse the repository, check individual problem solutions, and run them locally using any Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
